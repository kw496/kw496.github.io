  <div class = "text-body">
    <p>
      One of the key responsibilities of a DevOps engineer is to create a full-
      stack workload for the company they‚Äôre working for. In other words,
      they‚Äôre the ones setting everything up backstage, so that you can access
      Netflix or Slack or Zoom 24/7, with no interruptions.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      However, as you can imagine, this is no easy feat. It can get tedious
      really quickly, especially when it involves setting up hundreds,
      or even thousands, of machines.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      Thus, I was part of a project to offer support for Ansible automation
      capabilities on IBM Cloud.
    </p></br>
  </div>

  <div class = "text-body">
    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Context</h1>

    <h4>The Apple Shortcuts app is a great example of automation</h4>

    <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
      Cloud computing can get complicated, so let me set the scene for you
      with an analogy.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      If you own an iPhone or iPad, you‚Äôve probably seen, or even used,
      the Shortcuts app. I think this app is totally underrated, because
      it has some really cool capabilities that most people don‚Äôt know about.
    </p>
  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img margin-bottom-64px" src = "Images/apple-shortcuts-app.png">

  <div class = "text-body">
    <p>
      For instance, you can create a shortcut where every time you say
      ‚ÄúHey Siri, I‚Äôm getting pulled over,‚Äù your phone will automatically send
      your location to a specified emergency contact, and start taking a video
      with the front camera.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      Now, imagine if you had to do these things as you saw the red and blue
      lights flashing in your rearview. You‚Äôd probably be way overwhelmed,
      right? üò´
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      The Shortcuts app is a great example of how automation can really come in
      clutch in the consumer space.
    </p>

    <h4>Apple Shortcuts app : consumer :: Ansible : DevOps engineer</h4>

    <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
      Similarly, DevOps engineers get way annoyed with having to do certain
      tasks by hand.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      However, instead of telling Siri to send their location or take a video,
      they ask Ansible (an automation tool) to install web servers and create
      databases.
    </p>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img margin-bottom-64px" src =
  "Images/ansible-devops-engineer.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

    <p>
      Now, installing a web server or creating a database in the first place
      is no easy task. But imagine doing that up to hundreds of times?
    </p>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img margin-bottom-64px"
  src = "Images/hundreds-times.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

    <p>
      Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs not very fun. That‚Äôs where Ansible really shines.
      It takes something difficult, and turns it into an easy and repeatable
      process.
    </p>

  <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Goal</h1>

  <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
    Okay, now that you understand why Ansible is so great, you understand why
    it made sense for us to support Ansible on IBM Cloud.
  </p>

  <p class = "main-point">
    Our goal was then to figure out what the Ansible experience would look like
    on IBM Cloud.
  </p>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img" src = "Images/ios-gmail-comparison.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

    <p class = "caption">
      At some point, a designer had to determine how users would access Gmail
      (an existing service) on iOS. Similarly, we had to figure out how users
      would access Ansible (an existing tool) on IBM Cloud.
    </p>

    <p class = "margin-top-64px">
      At the beginning of the project, there were two directions we could‚Äôve
      gone in: aligning with IBM Cloud or aligning with Ansible.
      I explored both.
    </p>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Exploration 1: Align with IBM Cloud
    </h1>

    <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
      Whenever you create or buy something on IBM Cloud, you generally
      follow this pattern:
    </p></br>

    <ol class = "numbered-list">
      <li>Click on the <b>Create</b> button.</li>
      <li>Go through the create flow.</li>
      <li>Land on the <b>resource detail</b> page, where you can edit
      things.</li>
    </ol>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img" src = "Images/align-ibm-cloud.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

    <p class = "caption">
      I mocked up a create flow that aligned more with existing IBM Cloud
      patterns. However, I noticed that this exploration had inconsistent
      create and edit experiences.
    </p>

    <p class = "margin-top-64px">
      Now, this is great if you‚Äôre buying something (like a Kubernetes cluster
      or a virtual server) and you need to perform a transaction with
      the customer.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      However, if we‚Äôre talking about creating something that‚Äôs free (like an
      Ansible playbook), it doesn‚Äôt really make sense to create things one way,
      and then edit things in a completely different way. This just ends up
      increasing the cognitive load for the user. In other words, it‚Äôs bad UX üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
    </p>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Exploration 2: Align with Ansible
    </h1>

    <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
      Next, I looked at Ansible. Here, the experience of creating something is
      identical to that of editing something.
    </p>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img" src = "Images/align-with-ansible.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

    <p class = "caption">
      I mocked up a create flow that aligned more with Ansible patterns.
      Although this exploration had consistent create and edit experiences,
      it did not afford many opportunities to guide the user through the
      create process.
    </p>

    <p class = "margin-top-64px">
      It‚Äôs like when you create a data table on Excel. When you want to edit
      that data table later on, you know exactly how to do it, because you had
      gone through the same process to create it.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      So that was good. The user didn‚Äôt have to go through another learning
      curve to edit something.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      However, I found that this flow gave little opportunity for us to guide
      the user through the create experience ü§î
    </p>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Exploration 3: Combine the two
    previous approaches</h1>

    <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
      So ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî I looked into combining the two approaches.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      Although I had initially wanted to do away with the create page completely
      (so that we could have more consistent create and edit experiences),
      this would have been completely inconsistent with IBM Cloud‚Äôs existing
      create patterns.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      Thus, as a compromise, I intentionally designed the create page to be as
      minimal as possible, so that the bulk of the create flow would actually
      reside on the resource detail page.
    </p>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img" src = "Images/combine-approaches.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

  <p class = "caption">
    While I had initially wanted to do away with the create page (second screen)
    completely, I realized this would have have been completely inconsistent
    with IBM CLoud‚Äôs existing create patterns. Thus, I ended up intentionally
    designing the create page to be as minimal as possible.
  </p>


  <p class = "margin-top-64px">
    Moreover, I also had to figure out how to guide the user through the create
     experience (as opposed to just throwing them into the deep end and having
     them figure it out for themselves). So here are a few high-fidelity changes
     that I made:
  </p>

  </div>

  <div class = "several-image-row">
    <div>
      <h4 class = "image-label">Version 1</h4>
      <img class = "an-image" src = "Images/num-pi-v1.png">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4 class = "image-label">Version 2</h4>
      <img class = "an-image" src = "Images/num-pi-v2.png">
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class = "text-body">
    <p class = "caption">
      For each step, I added a number and a progress indicator icon. This way,
      from the user‚Äôs perception, instead of landing on a page with a bunch of
      section headings, they would land on a specific step they were supposed
      to focus on in the context of a linear progression.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "several-image-row">
    <div>
      <h4 class = "image-label">Version 1</h4>
      <img class = "an-image" src = "Images/save.png">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4 class = "image-label">Version 2</h4>
      <img class = "an-image" src = "Images/next.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "text-body">
    <p class = "caption">
      I changed the call to action from <b>Save</b> to <b>Next</b>. Again,
      this was done with the intention of instilling a sense of linear
      progression for the user. <b>Save</b> implies that you can edit any
      section you want, whereas <b>Next</b> implies that you must finish this
      section before you go to the next section.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "several-image-row">
    <div>
      <h4 class = "image-label">Version 1</h4>
      <img class = "an-image" src = "Images/edit-icon.png">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4 class = "image-label">Version 2</h4>
      <img class = "an-image" src = "Images/chevron.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "text-body">
    <p class = "caption">
      I changed the edit icon to a chevron. This was done to eliminate the
      user‚Äôs sense of being overwhelmed with many sections to edit, and to
      promote the sense of situating oneself in a focused step in the context
      of a linear progression.
    </p>

  <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Final prototype</h1>

  <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
    And *drumroll please* all of these explorations and high-fidelity changes
    resulted in this final prototype.
