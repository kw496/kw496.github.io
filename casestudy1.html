    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Context</h1>
    <p>IBM Cloud Schematics is an infrastructure as code tool. If that sounds a little complex, let me
      break it down for you.</p>
      </br>

    <p>
      Normally, everytime a DevOps engineer wants to create a resource,
      they need to go to IBM Cloud and manually create them, one by one. We can compare this to how everytime you want to
      go somewhere by car, you need to follow a set of Google Maps instructions, one by one.</p>
      </br>
    <p>However, with IBM Cloud Schematics, a DevOps engineer can create several resources with just a few lines
      of code. Similarly, with Uber, you can just enter the address of your desired location, and then sit back
      and relax.<p>

    <p class = "main-point">Schematics is like the Uber of provisioning resources - instead of
    creating each resource one by one, you just define all your resources with a few lines of code,
    just like how instead of following Google Maps directions one by one, you just enter
    an address in the Uber app.</p>

    <div class = "row">
      <div class = "column">
        <img class = "ubergooglescreenshot" src = "images/googlemaps.png">
      </div>
      <div class = "column">
        <img class = "ubergooglescreenshot" src = "images/uber.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">User Research</h1>
    <p>We spoke with four DevOps engineers (both internal and external to IBM), and asked each
      user to deploy a starter Terraform template (the container for the few lines of code I was
      talking about earlier). We discovered that a big issue for each person was filling out the values -
      nobody actually filled out the necessary values to successfully complete the task.</p>
    <p class = "main-point">None of our four users actually filled out the necessary values to successfully
    complete the task.</p>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column">
          <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "user_research_screenshot" src = "images/userresearch.png">
        </div>
      </div>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Problem</h1>
      <p>We found that our main problem was that there were too many variable values to fill out. New users
      were getting overwhelmed, and experienced users became annoyed with having to fill out the same
      values over and over again.</p>
      <p class = "main-point"> Schematics users want to fill out the values for variables
      so that they can generate and apply plan, but they get annoyed having to fill out the values.</p>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Design Explorations</h1>
      <h1 class = "case_study_section_subtitle">1. Side Panel</h1>
      <p>We wanted to enable users to store their values in reusable groups (we called these "shared
        data sets"), so we designed a side panel that pushes the content to the left,
        so that the user can see all of their stored shared data sets.</p>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column">
          <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "side_panel_screenshot" src = "images/sidepanelscreenshot.png">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Our intuition was that the side panel required a bit of a learning curve, it made up
        for that by clearly laying out the content, and therefore, facilitating a strong
        user understanding of the feature.</p>
      <p class = "main-point">Our assumption was that the side panel was complex at first glance, but would ultimately facilitate
        overall user understanding of the feature.</p>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_subtitle">2. Combo Box</h1>
      <p>We were also inspired by Google Chrome's autofill feature, so we applied that concept to our
      second design exploration - the combo box. Here, the user begins to type in a value,
      and Schematics "remembers" their previously stored values, and suggests a previously used
      shared data set.</p>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column">
          <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "side_panel_screenshot" src = "images/comboboxscreenshot.png">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Here, our intuition was that the combo box would be more discoverable (since the user will be typing
        into the text input field anyway). Moreover, since the combo box functionality inherently filters down the
        amount of information presented as the user types, we assumed that the combo box would be less overwhelming,
        and thus, easier to use. Our concern here, however, was that the combo box would be <span class = "italic">too</span> simple,
      and thus, would not ensure that the user would have a complete understanding of the feature.</p>
      <p class = "main-point">Our assumption was that the combo box was discoverable and easy to use, but that it may
        be too simple, to the extent that it infringes on the user's ability to fully grasp the concept of shared data sets.</p>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_subtitle">Which one?</h1>
      <p>Because both explorations had pros and cons, we decided it would be best to perform some user testing on the
        two concepts to help us decide.</p>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column">
          <img id = "whichone_screenshot" class = "case_study_screenshot" src = "images/whichone.png">
        </div>
      </div>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">User Testing</h1>
      <p>With the help of our researcher, we ran 8 total user tests. Because this feature (shared data sets)
        was high on our priority list, we had a tight timeline, so we recruited internally by Slack messaging existing
        Schematics users. We conducted user tests both in person and over WebEx.</p>

      </div>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Insights</h1>
      <p>We used an affinity diagram to make sense of our qualitative data. This kind of data was especially
      essential to our design decision-making process, because we needed to know the rationale behind
      why users preferred one concept over another, so we could iterate accordingly.</p>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column">
          <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "side_panel_screenshot" src = "images/affinitydiagram.png">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>We largely validated our existing assumptions through user testing. With the side panel,
      we found that users couldn't find it easily, nor did they find it easy to use. However,
      as we had suspected, in the end, it facilitated overall user understanding.</p>
      </br>
      <p>On the other hand, with the combo box, we found that while users easily discovered it and
        had no problems figuring out how to use it, it was hard for users to actually understand
        the concept of shared data sets.
        <p class = "main-point">While the side panel was hard to use, but easy to understand,
          the combo box was easy to use, but difficult to understand.</p>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Back to the Drawing Board</h1>
      <p>While both intial concepts had advantages, they also clearly had some underlying
      problems. Thus, we went back to the drawing board, and came up with a design that
      combined the best qualitites of both initial concepts.</p> </br>

      <p>We decided on a dropdown as the final design, so that the user could
        easily interact with the feature, while still gaining a clear understanding
      of what was going on via the separation of elements.</p>

      </div>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Final Round of User Testing</h1>
      <p>We did a final round of user testing, and this final design received positive feedback. It also increased
      the task completion rate.</p>

      </div>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Moving Forward</h1>
      <p>This feature is currently being developed, and it will be used all throughout the platform - not just
      for variables, but also for sensitive data, like keys and credentials.</p>
