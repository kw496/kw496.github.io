    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Context</h1>
    <p>IBM Cloud Schematics is an infrastructure as code tool. If that sounds a little complex, let me
      break it down for you.</p>
      </br>

    <p>
      Normally, everytime a DevOps engineer wants to create a resource,
      they need to go to IBM Cloud and manually create them, one by one. We can compare this to how everytime you want to
      go somewhere by car, you need to follow a set of Google Maps instructions, one by one.</p>
      </br>
    <p>However, with IBM Cloud Schematics, a DevOps engineer can create several resources with just a few lines
      of code. Similarly, with Uber, you can just enter the address of your desired location, and then sit back
      and relax.<p>

    <p class = "main-point">Schematics is like the Uber of provisioning resources - instead of
    creating each resource one by one, you just define all your resources with a few lines of code,
    just like how instead of following Google Maps directions one by one, you just enter
    an address in the Uber app.</p>

    <div class = "row">
      <div class = "column">
        <img class = "case_study_screenshot" src = "images/googlemaps.png">
      </div>
      <div class = "column">
        <img class = "case_study_screenshot" src = "images/uber.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">User Research</h1>
    <p>We spoke with four DevOps engineers (both internal and external to IBM), and asked each
      user to deploy a starter Terraform template (the container for the few lines of code I was
      talking about earlier). We discovered that a big issue for each person was filling out the values -
      nobody actually filled out the necessary values to successfully complete the task.</p>
    <p class = "main-point">None of our four users actually filled out the necessary values to successfully
    complete the task.</p>

          <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "user_research_screenshot" src = "images/userresearch.png">
        </div>
      </div>

      <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Problem</h1>
      <p>We found that our main problem was that there were too many variable values to fill out. New users
      were getting overwhelmed, and experienced users became annoyed with having to fill out the same
      values over and over again.</p>
      <p class = "main-point"> Schematics users want to fill out the values for variables
      so that they can generate and apply plan, but they get annoyed having to fill out the values.</p>
