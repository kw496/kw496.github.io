    <p class = "bio"> I just graduated with my Master
    of Professional Studies in Information Science, with a concentration in UX design. </p>
    <p class = "bio"> I love the smell of rain and the texture of al dente pasta. I also
    have a Golden Retriever, and I enjoy cooing to him on FaceTime as he
    ignores my existence. </p>
    <p class = "bio"> For me, product design is an extension of my artistic and perfectionist self.
    Design is about appreciating the small things in life, and exploring
    what it means to be human. </p>
