    <p>
      Flux is a mobile app that allows college students to check how crowded
      campus facilities are before they go. It is currently available on iOS
      and Android.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "text-body">
    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Problem</h1>

    <p class = "main-point">
      College students want to check how crowded campus facilities are, so that
      they can save time.
    </p>


    <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
      First things first - the Flux team wanted to test whether this was an
      actual problem that students faced. Thus, we used the Wizard of Oz MVP
      approach.
    </p></br></br>

    <p>
      We built out a quick webpage, as shown below. Behind the scenes,
      we had a team member literally sitting at the location, counting how
      many spots were open, and manually updating the webpage in real time.
    </p>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img margin-bottom-64px" src = "images/flux-mvp.png">

  <div class = "text-body">
    <p>
      In the course of two to three days, we had 800 users visit the page. This
      validated our assumption that there was interest in knowing how crowded a
      specific spot was on campus. We took this as a signal to move forward
      with the project.
    </p>

  </div>


    <img class = "case-study-img"
    src = "images/flux-mvp-analytics.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Team</h1>

    <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
      And thus, an 11-person team was formed. We consisted of two
      product managers, three designers, and six developers.
    </p>

  </div>

  <img class = "case-study-img" src =
  "images/flux-team.png">

  <div class = "text-body">

  <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">How do we collect our data?</h1>

  <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
    Our first problem was to figure out how to collect data.
  </p></br></br>

  <p>
    In our initial discussions, we considered buying sensors, and placing them
    in areas across campus. However, after some preliminary research,
    we found that this would be a very costly option - definitely not in the
    budget of an undergrad project team.
  </p></br></br>

  <p>
    Now, we knew we had to provide some sort of initial data for users. Thus,
    each team member physically went to the facilities and
    manually recorded the density every twenty minutes. Now, we at least had
    data - something to show our users.
  </p></br></br>

  <p>
    But the problem with this was it didn't scale. Thus, the real game changer,
    was when we started talking to facility managers at gyms,
    dining halls and libraries. We found that they actually kept real-time
    records of density levels throughout the day.
  </p>

  <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">Low-fidelity wireframes</h1>

  <p class = "margin-top-24-px">
    Once we found out we would be able to work with the facility managers,
    we began the design work. We started with low-fidelity wireframes.

    After collaborating with our developers, we were able to realize our designs
    in production.
