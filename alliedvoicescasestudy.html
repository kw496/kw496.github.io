    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">💡   How an Uber ride inspired this
      project</h1>

    <p>It was Tuesday, March 17th, 2020. Just four days ago, my manager had announced
      that everyone should start working from home, due to the exponential growth
      of the coronavirus.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      I had realized that if this COVID-19 situation was going to get worse,
      I should probably stock up on my Asian groceries. So of course, I had
      decided to make an H-Mart run. Which is how I found myself standing right
      outside my apartment building on a Tuesday evening.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      I glanced up from the Uber app, and saw a black Ford Escape from the corner of my eye.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      <span class = "italic">There he was! </span>I waved at the driver.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      He noticed me walking up, and started pulling up.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      But then, I heard…
    </p></br>

    <p>
      **click**
    </p></br>

    <p><span class = "italic">
      Did I hear that right? Did he just lock the doors?
    </span></p></br>

    <p>
      My assumption was confirmed when he rolled down his windows, and asked,
      “what’s going on? Are you sick?”
    </p></br>

    <p>
      And my heart sank. I had already been a little bit self-conscious about
      wearing a mask, especially because the CDC had been giving unclear
      instructions on whether we should wear a mask.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      Moreover, a week ago, I had read that some Asians in Europe had faced
      harassment for wearing masks, because in western culture, wearing a mask
      implies that you’re sick, whereas in Asian culture, wearing a mask is a
      protection method, both for the wearer, as well as for the people around
      them.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      I shook my head, and said, “no, I’m not sick.”
    </p></br>

    <p>
      “Then why are you wearing a mask? You know you’re not supposed to,”
      he responded.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      “Yeah, but I just wanted to protect myself…”
    </p></br>

    <p>
      **click**
    </p></br>

    <p>
      He unlocked the doors.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      As I got in, he said “You should listen to the CDC. China didn’t listen
      to them, and look what happened.”
    </p></br>

    <p>
      Immediately, several emotions washed over me —
    </p></br>

    <p>
      — embarrassment and shame
      (<span class = "italic">am i a bad person for wearing a mask?</span> ),
    </p></br>

    <p>
      — indignation
      (<span class = "italic">doesn’t my mask protect him too?</span> ),
    </p></br>

    <p>
      — anger
      (<span class = "italic">why is he attacking China? I’m Chinese, so is he
        trying to indirectly attack me?</span> ),
    </p></br>

    <p>
      — confusion
      (<span class = "italic">should I say something to him? What’s the best
        way to handle this situation?</span> ),
    </p></br>

    <p>
      — and fear
      (<span class = "italic">how is he going to react if I say something to
        him? Will I make him dislike people like me even more? But what if I
        don’t stand up for my values? Am I going to regret my silence later?</span> ),
    </p></br>

    <p>
      In the end, embarrassment won over — I felt so uncomfortable wearing a mask
      in his car, that I took it off.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      The whole ordeal took less than 15 minutes, but it had felt like an
      eternity. The worst part? Those emotions long outlasted the actual
      interaction. In fact, I went back and forth between <span class = "italic">
      you’re-just-overreacting</span>
      and <span class = "italic">that-actually-wasn’t-okay-and-you-should’ve-
      said-something</span> for several
      more days afterwards.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      That’s what inspired Allied Voices.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      I never want anyone to feel any of the emotions I did. Media outlets
      often report on big news, like physical or verbal assaults (which are
      gut-wrenching and heartbreaking), but not on the smaller day-to-day
      microaggressions that people like you and me are more likely to experience.
      Which explains why I had no idea how to handle the Uber situation.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      Allied Voices seeks to minimize those emotions, and to prepare you on how
      to maturely handle those kinds of situations.
    </p></br>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">🤓   Our design process</h1>

    <p>
      So far, we’ve done three rounds of user testing, with all of them involving
      both foundational and conceptual research.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      The first two rounds of user testing helped us conceptualize four use cases,
      which then served as a guide for our third round of testing. I’ll talk
      through the four use cases, and how our research and design process brought
      them to life, as well as how they, in turn, informed our process.
    </p></br>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">😟   1. “I’m concerned about me and my
      family’s safety.”</h1>

    <p>
      In our initial round of user testing, we found that users would
      immediately go to the search bar to type in their current location, and
      view the race-related incidents in their vicinity. Their second instinct
      was to search the city or zip code of their family members.
    </p>

    <div class = "row">
      <div class = "column">
        <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "user_research_screenshot" src = "images/first-iteration.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This made sense, because in times of racial and political tension, people
      are especially prone to watching out for their own safety, as well as that
      of their family members.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      However, we quickly reqlized that if we only included race-related incidents,
      users might walk away feeling demoralized, or at worst, hesitant to even
      walk out the door. Thus, we decided to add:
    </p></br>

    <p>
      1. Acts of allyship
    </p>

    <p>
      2. Stories about day-to-day incidents
    </p>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">👨‍👩‍👧‍👦    2. “I want to know that I’m not the only one who’s experienced this.”</h1>

    <p>
      We went on to implement the design for day-to-day stories.
    </p>

    <div class = "row">
      <div class = "column">
        <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "user_research_screenshot" src = "images/second-iteration-2.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Here, our intention was to fulfill the user’s need for a sense of community.
      Often, when you experience a race-related incident (or any traumatic event),
      it’s important to know that you’re not alone, that there are other people
      who have experienced the same thing.
    </p></br>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">🤔   3. “I don’t want to experience
      this ever again. How do I make sure I do the right thing next time?”</h1>

    <p>
      In our second round of research, we found that every single user we
      interviewed had experienced some form of a microaggression. Moreover,
      we noticed that a majority of our users didn’t know how to handle
      themselves in the moment, and that they wish they had guidance.
    </p></br>



    <div class = "row">
      <div class = "column">
        <img class = "case_study_screenshot" id = "user_research_screenshot"
        src = "images/third-iteration.png">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Thus, we went forward with a new design to fulfill this need. Here,
      we included a section on how the subject of the story navigated their
      tough situation, so that our user might be able to apply the same
      methods and techniques in the future.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      Moreover, we included a resources section to further guide the user
      through expert advice, be it from psychologists or their state government,
      on how to navigate tough situations.
    </p></br>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">💪   4. “I know how to handle
      tough situations now. And I want to help others do the same.”</h1>

    <p>
      In the future, we plan on designing for user submissions. Once the user
      knows how to handle tough situations, they might find themselves handling
      one in the future. Afterwards, hopefully, they’ll want to share how they
      handled the situation, so that others can learn from them, the same way
      they initially learned from others.
    </p></br>

    <p>
      Moreover, this way, we will have a rich library of searchable content
      for the rest of our users.
    </p></br>

    <h1 class = "case_study_section_title">🌅   So, what’s next for Allied
      Voices?</h1>

      <p>
        1. Build out functionalities for minorities other than Asians.
        We stand with the black, Latinx, female, and LGBTQIA+ communities,
        and we want Allied Voices to reflect that.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Generate content for acts of allyship. We want people to know how to
        be prepared if they are ever a victim, but we also want to empower
        people to be allies. In a world where others willingly step up as allies,
        you might never have to find yourself a victim.
